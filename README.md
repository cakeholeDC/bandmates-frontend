# Bandmates
Bandmates is a social media site for musicians. Individual musicians can create profiles, post samples of their work, and browse local bands. Bands also have profiles, and band leaders can browse for musicians to fill slots.

## Installation
Before running Bandmates locally, you will need to clone down the back-end repo [Bandmates API](https://github.com/cakeholeDC/bandmates-backend)

### Install Dependencies
Before starting the development server, run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed and up to date.

### Start Local App
To run Bandmates in development mode, run the following command in the project directory:
### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. (if running the Rails API locally, this will default to http://localhost:3001)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
